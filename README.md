# Information Extraction using Regex and Spacy
Introduction:
Information Extraction (IE) is a process of extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured data sources such as text documents. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used to perform IE tasks on textual data. Two commonly used NLP techniques for IE are Regular Expressions (Regex) and Spacy.
Regex and Spacy are two NLP techniques used for information extraction from text data. Regex is good for simple tasks like extracting emails, phone numbers, and dates, but has limitations for complex tasks. Spacy is designed for fast and efficient NLP tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction, making it a better choice for complex extraction tasks. Choose the tool based on the specific requirements of the task.

# Named Entity Recognition (NER) using Spacy
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a popular NLP task used to extract structured information from unstructured or semi-structured text data. NER involves identifying and classifying named entities such as people, places, organizations, dates, etc. Spacy is a popular Python library used for NER tasks.
To use Spacy for NER tasks, you first need to install the library and download the pre-trained models. You can then use the library to process the text data and extract named entities. You can also train custom NER models using Spacy's API and annotated datasets.

# Question Answering System using AutoModelForQuestionAnswering
Question Answering (QA) is an NLP task that involves answering questions based on a given context or document. The task involves identifying relevant information from the context and using it to generate an answer to the question. AutoModelForQuestionAnswering is a tool in the Hugging Face Transformers library used for QA tasks.

# Text Cleaning in NLP using NLTK
Text cleaning is an important step in NLP tasks as it helps to remove noise, irrelevant information, and inconsistencies from text data. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular Python library used for text cleaning tasks in NLP.
