# Information Extraction using Regex and Spacy
Introduction:
Information Extraction (IE) is a process of extracting structured information from unstructured or semi-structured data sources such as text documents. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be used to perform IE tasks on textual data. Two commonly used NLP techniques for IE are Regular Expressions (Regex) and Spacy.
Regex and Spacy are two NLP techniques used for information extraction from text data. Regex is good for simple tasks like extracting emails, phone numbers, and dates, but has limitations for complex tasks. Spacy is designed for fast and efficient NLP tasks like named entity recognition and relation extraction, making it a better choice for complex extraction tasks. Choose the tool based on the specific requirements of the task.
